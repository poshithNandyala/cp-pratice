# 🧠 cp_practice

A personal Competitive Programming (CP) repository to organize problems I've solved, concepts I've learned, and strategies I'm developing — all under the folder `anonymous/`.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure (inside `anonymous/`)

### 🔹 `TLE/`
Problems from the [TLE: Time Limit Eliminators CP Sheet](https://www.tle-eliminators.com/cp-sheet), organized by Codeforces-style difficulty rating (e.g., `800`, `1000`, `1200`, etc.).  
Useful for rating-based, structured practice.

### 🔹 `contests/`
Solutions from Codeforces contests (Div. 2/3, Educational Rounds, etc.).  
Currently a work-in-progress — more to be added gradually.

### 🔹 `important/`
Key concepts, notes, and algorithms like:
- Binary Search
- Dynamic Programming
- (Coming soon: DFS, BFS, Binary Exponentiation, etc.)

### 🔹 `patterns (of problems)/`
Templates and common problem-solving patterns across contests.  
Useful for recognition and speed during timed rounds.

### 🔹 `tags/`
Topic-wise problem collections.  
Example: `tags/dp/` contains Dynamic Programming problems.

### 🔹 `random/`
Miscellaneous or unorganized problems — used for raw practice or testing out ideas.

## 🚀 Goals

- Solve TLE sheet systematically to strengthen core concepts
- Create and refine CP templates for contests
- Keep notes and patterns for fast recall
- Track growth through categorized and tagged solutions

---

## 🔧 TODO

- [ ] Upload more **contest** solutions
- [ ] Add and clean up reusable **CP templates** (Binary Search, DFS, BFS, etc.)
- [ ] Improve tagging and topic coverage
- [ ] Expand the `patterns` folder with real problem links and explanations
