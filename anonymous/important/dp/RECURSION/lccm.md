# LCCM Framework for Recursion

The **LCCM Framework** is a structured approach to solving recursion problems. It stands for:

1. **Level**: Define the level of recursion.
2. **Choice**: Identify the choices available at each level.
3. **Check**: Define the base case or stopping condition.
4. **Move**: Make the recursive call to move to the next level.

## Steps to Apply LCCM

### 1. Level
Determine what each level of recursion represents. For example:
- An index in an array.
- A node in a tree.
- A step in a sequence.

### 2. Choice
Identify the decisions or actions you can take at each level. For example:
- Include or exclude an element.
- Move left or right in a tree.
- Increment or decrement a value.

### 3. Check
Define the base case to stop recursion. For example:
- Reaching the end of an array.
- Encountering a null node in a tree.
- Meeting a specific condition.

### 4. Move
Make the recursive call to progress to the next level. Ensure you update the state (e.g., index, path, or sum) appropriately.

## Example: Subset Generation

```python
def generate_subsets(nums):
    def backtrack(index, current):
        # Check: Base case
        if index == len(nums):
            result.append(current[:])
            return
        
        # Choice 1: Exclude the current element
        backtrack(index + 1, current)
        
        # Choice 2: Include the current element
        current.append(nums[index])
        backtrack(index + 1, current)
        current.pop()  # Undo the choice (backtrack)
    
    result = []
    backtrack(0, [])
    return result

# Usage
print(generate_subsets([1, 2, 3]))
```

### Breakdown:
- **Level**: The index in the `nums` array.
- **Choice**: Include or exclude the current element.
- **Check**: Stop when the index equals the length of the array.
- **Move**: Increment the index and make recursive calls.

Use the LCCM framework to systematically solve recursion problems!
