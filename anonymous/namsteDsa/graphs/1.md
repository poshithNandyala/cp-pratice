[1] **THE ANSWER**

Yes — you **can optimize**, but the key insight is this:

👉 **For this problem, your solution is already close to optimal.**
However, there is **one unnecessary thing** you can remove to make it cleaner and faster.

---

### ❌ Unnecessary Part

You are using:

```cpp
vector<bool> vis
```

But the graph in this problem is a **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)**.
That means **cycles do not exist**, so **visited array is not required**.

### ✅ Optimized Version (Simpler & Faster)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void dfs(int node, vector<vector<int>>& graph,
             vector<int>& curr, vector<vector<int>>& ans) {

        if (node == graph.size() - 1) {
            ans.push_back(curr);
            return;
        }

        for (int nei : graph[node]) {
            curr.push_back(nei);
            dfs(nei, graph, curr, ans);
            curr.pop_back();
        }
    }

    vector<vector<int>> allPathsSourceTarget(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        vector<vector<int>> ans;
        vector<int> curr;
        curr.push_back(0); 
        dfs(0, graph, curr, ans);
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### 💡 Why this is better

* No `vis[]` → less memory
* Cleaner recursion
* Same time complexity, less overhead
* Matches **expected interview solution**

---

### ⏱ Complexity (Best Possible)

* **Time:** O(number of paths × path length) → unavoidable
* **Space:** O(path length) recursion stack

You **cannot do asymptotically better** because you must output **all paths**.

### **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)**

* Directed graph
* **No cycles**
* Topological order exists
* DFS does **not need visited[]** if DAG is guaranteed

📌 **Interview Line**

> “Since the graph is a DAG, we don’t need a visited array.”
