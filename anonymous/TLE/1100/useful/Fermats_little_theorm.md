I'll explain Fermat's Little Theorem clearly, step by step.

Fermat's Little Theorem states:

If $$p$$ is a prime number and $$a$$ is any integer not divisible by $$p$$, then:

$$a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$$

Or alternatively:

$$a^p \equiv a \pmod{p}$$

Let me break this down:

1. First, let's understand what this means:
   - Take any prime number $$p$$ (like 5, 7, 11, etc.)
   - Take any number $$a$$ that isn't divisible by $$p$$
   - When you raise $$a$$ to the power of $$(p-1)$$
   - And divide by $$p$$
   - The remainder will always be 1

2. Let's see an example with $$p = 5$$ and $$a = 2$$:
   - We calculate $$2^4$$ (since $$p-1 = 4$$)
   - $$2^4 = 16$$
   - When we divide 16 by 5, we get remainder 1
   - Therefore: $$16 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$$

3. Another example with $$p = 7$$ and $$a = 3$$:
   - Calculate $$3^6$$ (since $$p-1 = 6$$)
   - $$3^6 = 729$$
   - When we divide 729 by 7, we get remainder 1
   - Therefore: $$729 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$$

This theorem is incredibly useful in:
- Cryptography (especially RSA encryption)
- Testing for primality
- Solving modular arithmetic problems

Would you like me to show more examples or explain a specific application of this theorem?
