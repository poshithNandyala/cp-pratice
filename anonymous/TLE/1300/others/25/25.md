Below is a very detailed explanation of how the provided code solves the "Balanced Tunnel" problem:

---

## Problem Recap

You are given:
- A list of **n cars** entering a tunnel (order given by array **a**).
- A list of **n cars** exiting the tunnel (order given by array **b**).

The rules are:
- No overtaking is allowed inside the tunnel.
- A car must be fined if it definitely overtook at least one other car.  
  *“Definitely overtook”* means that the car entered later than another car but exited earlier than that car.

Your task is to count the number of cars that must be fined.

## High-Level Approach of the Code

1. **Mapping Exit Order Positions:**  
   The code creates an auxiliary array to quickly obtain the exit position (index) of any car (using car ID from array **b**).

2. **Translate Entry Order to Exit Order Positions:**  
   By using the position mapping, the code converts the entry order (array **a**) into an array **c** where each value represents the exit position of that car.

3. **Determine Fines:**  
   The code then iterates through the translated exit positions (array **c**) to count cars that “definitely overtook” another car. This is achieved by tracking the maximum exit position seen so far and comparing each car's exit position with that maximum.

## Code Walkthrough

### 1. Reading Input and Adjusting Indices

```cpp
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n), b(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    --a[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> b[i];
    --b[i];
  }
```

- **Purpose:**  
  - Read the number of cars **n**.
  - Read the order of entry (**a**) and the order of exit (**b**).
  - **Index Adjustment:**  
    The code subtracts 1 (using `--a[i]` and `--b[i]`) from each car id. This converts the car IDs from **1-indexed** to **0-indexed**. This is common in C++ because arrays are 0-indexed.

### 2. Building the Exit Position Map

```cpp
  vector<int> pos(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    pos[b[i]] = i;
  }
```

- **Purpose:**  
  - The `pos` vector is used to store the exit position for each car.
  - Here, `pos[b[i]] = i;` means that for the car with id `b[i]` (remember that it’s now 0-indexed), its exit order is `i`.
  
- **Usage Example:**  
  If the exit order is `[4, 3, 2, 5, 1]` (after converting to 0-index, it might look like `[3, 2, 1, 4, 0]` depending on the input), then for each car id, you quickly know its exit position by referencing `pos[car_id]`.

### 3. Translating Entry List into Exit Positions

```cpp
  vector<int> c(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    c[i] = pos[a[i]];
  }
```

- **Purpose:**  
  - The array **c** is built by replacing each car in the entry order (**a**) by its corresponding exit position.
  
- **Why This Transformation Works:**  
  - If car `X` entered at a certain position in **a**, `c[i]` now tells you where car `X` exited.
  - This transformed array allows us to compare the order of exit relative to the entry order to see if any car that entered later actually exited earlier than some car that entered before it.

### 4. Counting the Number of Fines

```cpp
  int mx = -1, ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (c[i] > mx) {
      mx = c[i];
    } else {
      ++ans;
    }
  }
```

- **How It Works:**
  - **mx Variable:**  
    - This keeps track of the maximum exit position encountered so far as we iterate over the array **c** in the order of entry.
  - **Iteration Logic:**
    - For each car (indexed by **i** in **c**), we check:
      - **If `c[i] > mx`:**  
        This means the current car has an exit position later than any car seen so far (i.e., it didn’t exit earlier than all previous cars).  
        **Action:** Update `mx` to `c[i]`.
      - **Else (when `c[i] <= mx`):**  
        This indicates that the current car exited before a car that entered before it (because `mx` represents a car with a later exit position coming from an earlier entry order).  
        **Action:** Increase the answer counter `ans`, because this car definitely overtook at least one car, and hence must be fined.
  
- **Conceptual Example:**  
  Suppose cars enter in order A, B, C.  
  If car A's exit position is 5, car B's exit position is 3, and car C's exit position is 6, then:
  - Start with `mx = -1`.
  - For car A: `c[A] = 5` which is > `-1` so update `mx` to 5.
  - For car B: `c[B] = 3` which is not greater than 5, so increment fine count (`ans++`).
  - For car C: `c[C] = 6` which is > 5, update `mx` to 6.
  - Final answer: one car (B) should be fined.

### 5. Output the Result

```cpp
  cout << ans << '\n';
  return 0;
```

- **Purpose:**  
  - Print the number of cars that have to be fined (i.e., the value of **ans**).

## Summary and Mapping Back to the Problem

- **Input Transformation:**  
  The input arrays are first adjusted for 0-indexing to simplify array indexing in C++.

- **Exit Position Mapping:**  
  By mapping each car to its exit position, the code can quickly determine for any car what its relative order on exit is.

- **Defining “Definitely Overtaking”:**  
  As we rebuild the entrance order into an array of exit positions (**c**), the problem reduces to checking if a later (entry) car's exit position is less than the maximum seen so far. This condition directly captures the overtaking rule: the car must have overtaken another if it exits before a car that entered before it.

- **Counting Fined Cars:**  
  Every time we see a car that does not set a new maximum exit value, it implies that the car exited before another (earlier entering) car, meaning it overtook that car. Increment the fine count accordingly.

The code is thus efficient (O(n) time complexity with simple linear passes and O(n) memory usage) and meets the problem’s constraints up to n = 10⁵.
