Let’s go through this solution step by step—first understanding **what the problem is asking**, then seeing **how the code tries to solve it**, and finally doing a **line‑by‑line walkthrough** with the data structures and algorithmic intuition.

## Problem Restatement

* We have $n$ people, each starting at $a_i$ and walking to $b_i$ at speed 1 (with $a_i < b_i$).
* All $2n$ values $\{a_i\}\cup\{b_i\}$ are distinct.
* When two people occupy the **same point at the same time**, they greet once.
* People keep moving (and can still “greet” at their destination if someone else passes through).
* **Goal**: Count total greetings over all pairs.

A key observation (common in these “two‑pointer” style problems) is:

> Two people $i$ and $j$ will meet **if and only if** their paths **cross** on the line.
> With $a_i < b_i$ and $a_j < b_j$, path $i$ goes from $a_i\to b_i$, path $j$ from $a_j\to b_j$.
>
> They cross exactly when
>
> $$
>   a_i < a_j < b_i < b_j
>   \quad\text{or}\quad
>   a_j < a_i < b_j < b_i
> $$
>
> i.e.\ their start/end intervals are “interleaved.”

One way to count these crossings is:

1. **Sort people by their start point** $a_i$.
2. As you sweep from smallest $a$ to largest $a$, keep track of the set of “endpoints” $b$ you’ve seen so far.
3. For the current person (with end $b$), count how many previously‐seen endpoints $b'$ are **less than** $b$. Each such $b'$ corresponds exactly to a crossing $(a'\!<a<b'<b)$.
4. Add that count to the answer, then insert the current $b$ into your data structure.

## Data Structures in the Code

* **`map<int,int> mp`**
  Holds pairs $(a_i,b_i)$ keyed by $a_i$.  Since all $a_i$ are distinct, this is just a way to sort the people by their starting position.

* **`vector<int> v`**
  Will hold *all* the $b_i$ values.  By sorting this vector, we can quickly (with `lower_bound`) count how many $b'$ are less than a given $b$.

---

## Overall Algorithm in the Code

1. **Read** $n$ pairs $(a,b)$.
2. **Store** each pair in `mp[a]=b`.  (Because `map` is ordered by key, this effectively sorts by $a$.)
3. **Collect** all the $b$ values in `v[]`, then `sort(v.begin(), v.end())`.
4. **Sweep** through `mp` in ascending $a$:

   * Let `it.second = b`.
   * Find `pos = lower_bound(v, b)`.  `pos - v.begin()` is the count of ends strictly less than `b`.
   * **Add** that count to the answer.
   * **Erase** that entry from `v` so future sweeps don’t recount it.
5. **Print** the total.

## Line‑by‑Line Walkthrough

```cpp
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
```

‑ Read number of test‑cases `t`.  For each test:
‑ Read `n`, the number of people.

---

```cpp
        map<int,int> mp;
        vector<int> v(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int a, b;
            cin >> a >> b;
            mp[a] = b;
            v[i] = b;
        }
```

* `mp[a] = b;`
  Stores the person whose start is `a` and end is `b`.  Because `map` keeps keys sorted, iterating over `mp` will go in increasing order of `a`.

* `v[i] = b;`
  Collects *all* end‐points into a vector for later sorting.

---

```cpp
        sort(v.begin(), v.end());
```

Sort the end‐points. Now `v` is in ascending order of `b`.

---

```cpp
        long long ans = 0;
        for (auto &it : mp) {
            auto pos = lower_bound(v.begin(), v.end(), it.second);
```

* We iterate through `mp` **in ascending** order of the start‐points $a$.
* `it.second` is the current end‐point $b$.
* `lower_bound(v.begin(),v.end(), b)` finds the **first** position in `v` where `v[pos] >= b`.
* Hence `pos - v.begin()` = number of elements in `v` that are **strictly** less than `b`.

---

```cpp
            ans += pos - v.begin();
```

* Every one of those strictly‐smaller $b'$ corresponds to a person who both:

  1. Started earlier (because we only inserted their `b'` into `v` before processing our current person), and
  2. Ends before our current person’s end `b` (since `b' < b`).

  This exactly counts the number of interleavings (crossings) $(a'\!<a<b'<b)$ with the current person.

---

```cpp
            v.erase(pos);
```

* Now that we’ve accounted for current `b`, we **remove** it from `v`.
* This prevents future iterations (with larger `a`) from *also* counting our current person’s end again.

---

```cpp
        }
        cout << ans << endl;
```

After the loop, `ans` holds the total number of crossings (greetings) across **all pairs**. Print it.

---

## Complexity & Why It Works

* **Sorting** the `v` vector initially: $O(n\log n)$.
* **Map insertion**: $n$ inserts at $O(\log n)$ each → $O(n\log n)$.
* **Sweeping**:

  * We do $n$ iterations.
  * In each, `lower_bound` on `v` is $O(\log n)$.
  * But `v.erase(pos)` on a `vector` is $O(n)$ in the worst case (shifts elements).
* **Total** worst‐case: $O(n^2)$, which for $n$ up to $2\times10^5$ *will* TLE in strict settings.

In many contest solutions, you’d replace the `vector`+`erase` with a **Fenwick Tree** or an order‐statistics tree (policy‑based data structure) to get all operations down to $O(\log n)$, yielding an overall $O(n\log n)$ solution that easily meets the 5 s time limit.

---

### Key Takeaways

1. **Sorting by start** using a `map<int,int>`.
2. **Counting how many ends are less** than the current end.
3. **Erasing** each end once processed to avoid double‐counting.
4. To make it fully efficient, swap out the `vector + erase` for a Fenwick Tree (or PBDS tree), so that both counting and removal are $O(\log n)$.

I hope this clarifies both **how** the code works line by line and **why** it solves the “greetings” (crossing‐intervals) problem!
