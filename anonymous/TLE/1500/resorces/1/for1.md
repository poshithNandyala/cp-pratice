Absolutely! Let's walk through **every detail** of the problem:

---

### 🔥 Goal:

Given an array `a[0 ... n-1]`, for every index `i`, find how many elements `a[j] <= a[i]` such that `j > i` (i.e., to the right of `i`).

---

## 🧠 Intuition

If we process the array from **right to left**, we can keep track of all the elements we've seen so far (i.e., everything to the right of the current index). Then, for each element `a[i]`, we ask:

> Among the elements I’ve already seen (i.e., a\[j] for j > i), how many are **less than or equal to** `a[i]`?

This is perfect for **prefix sums**: count how many values ≤ `a[i]` already exist.

We use a **Fenwick Tree** (aka Binary Indexed Tree) to do this efficiently in `O(log n)` time per query and update.

---

## 👣 Step-by-Step Implementation

We'll explain using this array:

```
a = {5, 3, 5, 2, 5, 3}
```

### Step 1: Coordinate Compression

Why?

We want to store counts for each number. But what if `a[i] = 1e9`? We can't make a Fenwick tree with 1e9 size.

Solution: **compress** the values to a smaller range using their **ranks**.

```cpp
comp = {2, 3, 5}
ranks = {1, 2, 3}
```

So `a` becomes:

```
a_ranks = {3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2}
```

---

### Step 2: Fenwick Tree Basics

A **Fenwick Tree** supports:

* `update(index, +1)` — increment count at position `index`
* `query(index)` — return **sum of counts** from index 1 to `index`

This lets us efficiently do prefix sum queries like:

> “How many values ≤ rank `r` have I seen?”

Which is exactly what we need.

---

### Step 3: Process From Right to Left

```cpp
Fenwick fw(size_of_unique_ranks);

for (int i = n-1; i >= 0; i--) {
    int r = rank_of(a[i]);       // convert a[i] to compressed rank
    ans[i] = fw.query(r);        // how many a[j] <= a[i] (j > i)?
    fw.update(r, 1);             // now include a[i] in seen values
}
```

### Step 4: Visual Simulation

Let’s simulate on our example:

```
a =       [5, 3, 5, 2, 5, 3]
a_ranks = [3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2]
```

We process from right to left:

---

🔹 i = 5:

* `rank = 2` (3)
* `fw.query(2)` = 0 → `ans[5] = 0`
* `fw.update(2)` → count of 3 becomes 1

---

🔹 i = 4:

* `rank = 3` (5)
* `fw.query(3)` = 1 → (only 3 is ≤ 5) → `ans[4] = 1`
* `fw.update(3)` → count of 5 becomes 1

---

🔹 i = 3:

* `rank = 1` (2)
* `fw.query(1)` = 0 → `ans[3] = 0`
* `fw.update(1)` → count of 2 becomes 1

---

🔹 i = 2:

* `rank = 3` (5)
* `fw.query(3)` = 3 → (we’ve seen 2, 3, 5) → `ans[2] = 3`
* `fw.update(3)` → count of 5 becomes 2

---

🔹 i = 1:

* `rank = 2` (3)
* `fw.query(2)` = 2 → (we’ve seen 2, 3) → `ans[1] = 2`
* `fw.update(2)` → count of 3 becomes 2

---

🔹 i = 0:

* `rank = 3` (5)
* `fw.query(3)` = 5 → all 5 elements to right ≤ 5 → `ans[0] = 5`
* `fw.update(3)` → count of 5 becomes 3

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

```
ans = [5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 0]
```

## 📚 Understanding Fenwick Tree Internals

Fenwick Tree is a binary tree structure in array form.

* To **update**, we do:

```cpp
for (; index <= N; index += index & -index)
    bit[index] += value;
```

* To **query prefix sum**, we do:

```cpp
for (; index > 0; index -= index & -index)
    sum += bit[index];
```

These `index & -index` tricks allow you to jump between nodes in the tree efficiently. If you're curious, I can give a **visual tree diagram** too.

---

## 🧩 Why Right-to-Left?

We're counting "how many elements to the **right** are ≤ current."

So by sweeping **right to left**, we can:

* Build the set of right-side elements *as we go*.
* Use a Fenwick tree to track how many of them are ≤ current value.

It’s efficient and avoids nested loops.

---

## 🚀 Time and Space Complexity

* Time:

  * Sorting for compression: `O(n log n)`
  * Loop with Fenwick Tree: `O(n log n)`
* Space:

  * Fenwick Tree + compressed arrays: `O(n)`

Much faster than naive `O(n²)`.

---

Would you like me to explain how the `index & -index` trick works inside the Fenwick tree update/query? Or how this applies to variants like strictly less than `< a[i]` instead of `<=`?

Great! Let's go even deeper. We’ll now cover:

1. **Why `index & -index` works in Fenwick Tree**
2. How it helps in **update and query**
3. Difference between `<= a[i]` vs `< a[i]`
4. Visual understanding of Fenwick Tree

---

## 🔧 1. **What is `index & -index`?**

This operation isolates the **lowest set bit** in the binary representation of an integer.

### 💡 Example:

Let's take `index = 6` (binary `110`):

```text
index        = 110
-negative    = 010 (two's complement of 6 = -6)

index & -index = 110 & 010 = 010 = 2
```

The result is the **lowest power of 2** that divides `index`. This tells us:

> how much to move **up or down the tree** in Fenwick structure.

---

## 🏗️ 2. How Fenwick Tree Uses `index & -index`

### 📦 BIT Structure:

We maintain an array `bit[]`, where each position stores **partial sums**.

* For `update(i, +1)`: move to parent nodes

  ```cpp
  while (i <= N) {
      bit[i] += value;
      i += (i & -i);  // move to next responsible node
  }
  ```

* For `query(i)`: sum of elements in \[1..i]

  ```cpp
  int sum = 0;
  while (i > 0) {
      sum += bit[i];
      i -= (i & -i);  // move to parent node
  }
  ```

This gives you `O(log n)` operations.

---

## 🌳 3. Visual Structure of BIT

Let’s say `N = 8`, and you build a `bit[9]` array (1-based index).

Each index in the BIT stores partial sum for a range of original array elements:

```text
Index   Binary     Range it covers
 1        001     a[1]
 2        010     a[1..2]
 3        011     a[3]
 4        100     a[1..4]
 5        101     a[5]
 6        110     a[5..6]
 7        111     a[7]
 8       1000     a[1..8]
```

This structure allows fast updating and querying of ranges.

---

## 🔁 4. Difference Between `<= a[i]` vs `< a[i]`

### `<= a[i]`:

You want to count how many elements are **less than or equal to** current.

You query:

```cpp
fw.query(rank[a[i]])  // includes a[i]
```

---

### `< a[i]`:

You want **strictly less than**.

You query:

```cpp
fw.query(rank[a[i]] - 1)
```

So just subtract 1 from rank when querying.

---

## 🧠 How to Remember:

* `update(r)` — When you *see* a value, mark it in the tree.
* `query(r)` — Ask: "How many values less than or equal to rank `r`?"

If you want strict comparison `<` instead of `<=`, then:

* Use `query(r - 1)`.

---

## 📌 Example Recap

For `a = [5, 3, 5, 2, 5, 3]`, after compression:

```cpp
a_ranks = [3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2]
```

* To count `≤ a[i]` → `fw.query(rank[a[i]])`
* To count `< a[i]` → `fw.query(rank[a[i]] - 1)`

---

## 🧪 Want to Test It?

Would you like a version of the code that gives both:

* Count of elements to right **≤ a\[i]**
* Count of elements to right **< a\[i]**

With debug prints to help visualize it?

I can add that next for clarity.
