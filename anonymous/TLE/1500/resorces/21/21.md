You're on the right track and the problem understanding you have is correct. Let's walk through the **detailed step-by-step explanation** of the **logic** and then explain **every concept required** for the C++ implementation so you fully understand how it works.

---

## ðŸ§  Problem Understanding

You are given:

* A tree of `n` vertices (`n-1` edges, no cycles, connected)
* Each edge is colored red (`0`) or black (`1`)
* A value `k` (length of sequences to consider)

We define a **"good" sequence** `[a1, a2, ..., ak]` as a sequence of vertices such that:

* You walk from `a1` to `a2`, then `a2` to `a3`, ..., finally `akâˆ’1` to `ak`, each time using the **shortest path** (which is unique in a tree)
* If **at least one black edge** is visited during this entire path, then the sequence is **"good"**

Your goal:
Count the total number of **good sequences** of length `k` among all possible `n^k` sequences.

---

## âœ¨ Key Insight

You want to **avoid walking on only red edges**.
So:

* If a sequence **only uses red edges**, then it's **bad**
* If it uses **any black edge**, it's **good**

Instead of trying to **count good sequences directly**, it's easier to:

1. Count all sequences: `n^k`
2. Subtract the number of **bad** sequences (i.e., sequences that only walk over red edges)

---

## ðŸ”§ How to Count Bad Sequences

* Remove all **black** edges from the tree
* What remains is a **forest** (i.e., multiple components made of only red edges)
* In each component:

  * Any sequence that **starts and stays** inside this component will **never** touch a black edge
  * So, all `k`-length sequences from nodes in the same component are **bad**

Let the sizes of red-only components be `p1, p2, ..., pm`. Then:

**Total bad sequences = p1^k + p2^k + ... + pm^k**

Thus, the answer is:

```text
good sequences = n^k - (p1^k + p2^k + ... + pm^k)
```

## ðŸ§® Math Concepts Required

### 1. **Modular Exponentiation**

To compute `a^b mod m` efficiently (since `k` can be up to 100, and `n` up to 1e5), use **binary exponentiation**:

```cpp
int pow(int a, int b, int m)
```

This computes `(a^b) % m` in `O(log b)` time.

### 2. **Graph Traversal**

You need to find connected components of red-only edges. Use **DFS (Depth-First Search)**:

```cpp
void dfs(int u)
```

This counts the size of the component rooted at `u`.

---

## ðŸ§° Data Structures Used

* **Graph** `g[N]` â€” adjacency list storing only red edges
* **Visited array** `vis[N]` â€” to avoid revisiting nodes in DFS
* **Variables**:

  * `n, k` â€” number of nodes and length of sequences
  * `sz` â€” size of current red component
  * `ans` â€” total number of good sequences

---

## ðŸ§± Code Walkthrough (Line by Line)

```cpp
#define int long long
```

âœ… All integers as `long long` to avoid overflow

---

```cpp
const int N = 2e5 + 5;
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
```

âœ… Constraints and modulo

---

### ðŸ“Œ Fast Power Function

```cpp
int pow(int a, int b, int m) {
    int ans = 1;
    while (b) {
        if (b & 1) ans = (ans * a) % m;
        b /= 2;
        a = (a * a) % m;
    }
    return ans;
}
```

Performs binary exponentiation â€” multiplies only when `b` has a 1 in binary.

---

### ðŸ“Œ DFS to find red-only components

```cpp
void dfs(int u) {
    if (vis[u]) return;
    sz++;
    vis[u] = true;
    for (auto &it : g[u])
        dfs(it);
}
```

Explores all nodes in one component and counts size in `sz`.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Main Function

```cpp
int32_t main() {
    IOS;
    cin >> n >> k;
    
    // Initially, all n^k sequences are possible
    int ans = pow(n, k, MOD);

    // Read all edges
    for (int i = 1; i <= n - 1; i++) {
        int u, v, x;
        cin >> u >> v >> x;
        if (x == 0)
            g[u].push_back(v), g[v].push_back(u); // only red edges
    }

    // For each unvisited node, start a DFS to find red component
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (vis[i]) continue;
        sz = 0;
        dfs(i);
        // Subtract bad sequences (sz^k) from total
        ans -= pow(sz, k, MOD);
        ans += MOD;      // avoid negative
        ans %= MOD;
    }

    cout << ans;
    return 0;
}
```

## ðŸ§ª Example

```
Input:
4 4
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1

Explanation:
- All edges black
- Tree is fully connected
- n = 4, k = 4 â†’ total sequences = 4^4 = 256
- All paths include black edge
- Only 4 sequences are bad: [1,1,1,1], [2,2,2,2], [3,3,3,3], [4,4,4,4]
- So good = 256 - 4 = 252
```

---

## âœ… Summary

* Count total `n^k`
* Subtract all sequences that live **inside red-only components**
* Use DFS to find red-only components
* Use fast exponentiation to compute powers modulo 1e9+7
* This gives final answer

If you want, I can **rewrite this in Python** or provide a **step-by-step dry run** of a sample input. Would that help?
