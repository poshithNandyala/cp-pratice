Great! Let's break it down in **ALL 4 WAYS**:
We'll solve the **Coin Change 2 problem** (number of combinations to make a given amount using unlimited coins), and explain each method with **intuition**, **code**, and **what’s happening under the hood**.

---

## 🧩 Problem Summary:

* **You have:** an array of `coins[]` (each coin can be used unlimited times)
* **Goal:** Count combinations (not permutations) of coins to sum up to `amount`

Example:

```cpp
coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 5
```

Answer: **4 combinations**

## 🔢 1. Recursion + Memoization (Top-Down DP)

### 🎯 Intuition:

Try all combinations using a recursive function.
Use **memoization** to avoid repeating subproblems.

### 🔁 State:

Let `f(i, amount)` be the number of ways to make `amount` using coins from index `i` onwards.

### 🔧 Code:

```cpp
int f(int i, int amount, vector<int>& coins, vector<vector<int>>& dp) {
    if (amount == 0) return 1;
    if (i == coins.size()) return 0;
    if (dp[i][amount] != -1) return dp[i][amount];

    int take = 0;
    if (coins[i] <= amount)
        take = f(i, amount - coins[i], coins, dp); // stay on same i
    int notTake = f(i + 1, amount, coins, dp);     // skip to next i

    return dp[i][amount] = take + notTake;
}

int change(int amount, vector<int>& coins) {
    vector<vector<int>> dp(coins.size(), vector<int>(amount + 1, -1));
    return f(0, amount, coins, dp);
}
```

### 🧠 Intuition:

* Branch recursively:

  * Either take `coins[i]` (stay on i)
  * Or skip it (go to i+1)
* Use `dp[i][amount]` to cache results

---

## 🧱 2. Tabulation (Bottom-Up DP, 2D)

### 🎯 Intuition:

Fill the table iteratively instead of using recursion.
Start from base cases and build up.

### 🔁 State:

Let `dp[i][j]` = ways to make amount `j` using first `i` coins.

### 🧮 Code:

```cpp
int change(int amount, vector<int>& coins) {
    int n = coins.size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(amount + 1, 0));
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) dp[i][0] = 1; // base: 1 way to make amount 0

    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= amount; j++) {
            int notTake = dp[i + 1][j];
            int take = (j >= coins[i]) ? dp[i][j - coins[i]] : 0;
            dp[i][j] = take + notTake;
        }
    }
    return dp[0][amount];
}
```

### 🧠 Intuition:

* Iterate from bottom row up (to mimic top-down recursion)
* Build up combinations from small to large
* Base: one way to make amount 0

---

## 🧾 3. Tabulation (Standard 2D Bottom-Up, Forward)

### 🎯 Intuition:

Classic style: each row adds another coin to the mix

### 🔁 State:

Let `dp[i][j]` = ways to make sum `j` using first `i` coins

### 📘 Code:

```cpp
int change(int amount, vector<int>& coins) {
    int n = coins.size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(amount + 1, 0));
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) dp[i][0] = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= amount; j++) {
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]; // not take
            if (j >= coins[i - 1])
                dp[i][j] += dp[i][j - coins[i - 1]]; // take
        }
    }
    return dp[n][amount];
}
```

### 🧠 Intuition:

* Row `i` builds from `i-1`, either taking or skipping coin `i-1`
* Add ways from same row when taking coin (unlimited use)

---

## 🧮 4. 1D Optimized DP (Most Efficient)

### 🎯 Intuition:

We only need one row at a time.
Use 1D array: `dp[j] = number of ways to make sum j`

### 📘 Code:

```cpp
int change(int amount, vector<int>& coins) {
    vector<int> dp(amount + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = 1;

    for (int coin : coins) {
        for (int j = coin; j <= amount; j++) {
            dp[j] += dp[j - coin];
        }
    }
    return dp[amount];
}
```

---

### 🧠 Why it works:

* Outer loop: coins (order matters — combinations)
* Inner loop: j = coin to amount (ensures each coin is only added after itself)
* `dp[j] += dp[j - coin]`: extend all ways to make `j - coin` by adding one `coin`

### 🧾 Visualization for `amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]`:

Each coin builds new ways on top of the previous state:

#### Coin = 1:

`[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`

#### Coin = 2:

`[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`

#### Coin = 5:

`[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`

## ✅ Summary Table

| Method              | Space Complexity | Time Complexity | Notes                                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Recursion + Memo    | O(N×amount)      | O(N×amount)     | Easy to write, can TLE on large input |
| Tabulation (2D)     | O(N×amount)      | O(N×amount)     | Bottom-up version                     |
| Tabulation (2D fwd) | O(N×amount)      | O(N×amount)     | Classic forward style                 |
| 1D DP               | **O(amount)**    | O(N×amount)     | Fastest, most space-efficient         |
