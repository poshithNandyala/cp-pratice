Certainly! Let's break down the function `msb_pos` in **very detailed** steps using **Markdown (MD) format**.

---

## üß† Function: `msb_pos(int n)`

```cpp
int msb_pos(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return -1;
    return 63 - __builtin_clzll(n);
}
```

---

## üìå Purpose

This function returns the **position of the most significant bit (MSB)** set to `1` in a **non-negative integer `n`**.
If `n` is `0`, it returns `-1` (as there are no bits set).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Concept: Most Significant Bit (MSB)

The **Most Significant Bit (MSB)** is the highest-order bit that is set to `1` in a binary number.

For example:

* `n = 18` (binary: `10010`) ‚Üí MSB is at position **4**
* `n = 1`  (binary: `0001`) ‚Üí MSB is at position **0**
* `n = 0`  (binary: `0000`) ‚Üí No bits set ‚Üí Return **-1**

**Note:** This function assumes bit positions are **0-indexed from the right**, i.e., LSB is at position `0`, MSB is at the highest index.

---

## üîç Step-by-Step Explanation

### ‚úÖ 1. Check if `n == 0`

```cpp
if (n == 0) return -1;
```

If `n` is zero, there are **no set bits** in its binary representation.
So, the **MSB doesn't exist**, and the function returns `-1`.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Use `__builtin_clzll(n)`

```cpp
__builtin_clzll(n)
```

* This is a **GCC/Clang compiler intrinsic**.
* It stands for: **Count Leading Zeros in a `long long` (64-bit) integer**.
* It returns the number of `0`s **before the first `1` bit** from the **left (MSB side)**.

#### Example:

Let‚Äôs say `n = 18` ‚Üí Binary (64-bit):

```
00000000...00000000 00000000 00000000 00010010
```

* The first `1` occurs at position `59` (from the left), so `__builtin_clzll(18) = 59`

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Compute Position of MSB

```cpp
return 63 - __builtin_clzll(n);
```

* Since we're working with a **64-bit number**, the **highest bit index is 63**.
* If the number has `x` leading zeros, then the position of the first `1` (MSB) is:

  ```
  63 - x
  ```

#### Example:

`n = 18`

* `__builtin_clzll(18) = 59`
* `MSB position = 63 - 59 = 4` ‚úÖ (Correct, 18 is `10010` ‚Üí MSB at pos 4)

---

## üß™ More Examples

| `n`    | Binary        | MSB Position |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| `0`    | `0000`        | `-1`         |
| `1`    | `0001`        | `0`          |
| `2`    | `0010`        | `1`          |
| `18`   | `10010`       | `4`          |
| `255`  | `11111111`    | `7`          |
| `1024` | `10000000000` | `10`         |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

* This function assumes that `int` is converted to a `long long` implicitly by `__builtin_clzll`.
* If you're compiling on a system where `int` is **not** 64 bits, the conversion is automatic due to how `__builtin_clzll` works.
* Works only with **non-negative integers**.
* Requires **GCC or Clang** compiler because `__builtin_clzll` is **not standard C/C++**.

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Step                     | Action                                    |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `n == 0`                 | Return `-1`                               |
| Use `__builtin_clzll(n)` | Count leading 0s in 64-bit representation |
| Subtract from 63         | Gives 0-based MSB position                |
