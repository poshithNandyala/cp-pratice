Good question 👍 — interviewers **do notice small cleanliness issues**, and you’re right: repeating

```cpp
ans = max(ans, c);
```

after the loop *feels* a bit awkward.

Your logic is **100% correct**, but there are **cleaner / more interview-friendly ways** to write it.

---

## ✅ Best interview-style rewrite (single update point)

### Idea

Update `ans` **every iteration**, not only on breaks.
Then you **don’t need** the extra line after the loop.

### Clean version 👇

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    string s;
    cin >> s;

    int n = s.size();
    int c = 1, ans = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (s[i] == s[i - 1]) {
            c++;
        } else {
            c = 1;
        }
        ans = max(ans, c);
    }

    cout << ans << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

### Why this is better for interviews

* ✅ **No special case after the loop**
* ✅ `ans` always reflects the best answer so far
* ✅ Reads naturally: *extend run → update answer*

Interviewers like this pattern.

## ✅ Even more concise (range-based style)

If they’re okay with slightly modern C++:

```cpp
int c = 1, ans = 1;
for (int i = 1; i < s.size(); ++i) {
    c = (s[i] == s[i - 1]) ? c + 1 : 1;
    ans = max(ans, c);
}
```

This shows:

* control over ternary operators
* compact logic
* still very readable

## 🚫 What NOT to worry about

Having this:

```cpp
ans = max(ans, c);
```

**after** the loop is **not wrong**, but:

* feels like a “fix”
* suggests you didn’t structure the loop to fully handle the answer

That’s why interviewers prefer the **single-update-inside-loop** approach.

---

## ⭐ Interview tip (important)

If asked **why you update inside the loop**, say:

> “I update the maximum at each step so I don’t need special handling after the loop.”

That sounds **clean and intentional**.

---

If you want, I can also show:

* a **functional / STL style** version
* a **one-liner using `std::count` (not recommended for interviews)**
* or rewrite using **two pointers terminology** for explanation

Just tell me 👍
