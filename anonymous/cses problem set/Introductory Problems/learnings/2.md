# Learning Notes – CSES Permutations

## Problem
Given `n`, print a permutation of numbers `1..n` such that the absolute difference
between every pair of adjacent elements is **greater than 1**.
If it is not possible, print `NO SOLUTION`.

---

## Key Observation
- For `n = 2` or `n = 3`, **no valid permutation exists**.
- For `n >= 4`, a valid permutation **always exists**.

---

## Core Idea (Most Important)
Place:
1. **All even numbers first**
2. **All odd numbers after**

This guarantees:
- Difference between adjacent numbers is at least `2`
- No special handling is needed for individual values like `n = 4`

---

## Why Even → Odd Works
- Difference between two consecutive even numbers is `2`
- Difference between last even and first odd is at least `1 + 1 = 2`
- Difference between consecutive odd numbers is also `2`

Hence, all adjacent differences are `> 1`.

---

## Final Approach
1. If `n == 2` or `n == 3`, print `NO SOLUTION`
2. Print all even numbers from `2` to `n`
3. Print all odd numbers from `1` to `n`

---

## Clean Interview-Ready Code
```cpp
if (n == 2 || n == 3) {
    cout << "NO SOLUTION\n";
    return 0;
}

for (int i = 2; i <= n; i += 2)
    cout << i << " ";

for (int i = 1; i <= n; i += 2)
    cout << i << " ";
